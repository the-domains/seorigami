description: 'CubeSats offer the chance for unprecedented access to space at a low cost. Low enough, indeed, that a group of UFO researchers were able to crowdsource the funds on IndieGoGo to launch their own UFO-hunting satellite into low-Earth orbit. It all started on IndieGoGo with the CubeSat 4 Disclosure project, led by Vancouver-based UFO researcher David Cote.'
