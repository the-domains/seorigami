description: 'Oliver launched a campaign this weekend to "Make Donald Drumpf Again". Along with an official site to promote the campaign, Oliver apparently took things a step further by trying to make it appear as though the hacktivist collective "Anonymous" were about to expose some secret about Trump that would cause him to leave the presidential race, Oliver apparently did this to promote the #makedonaldrumpfagain campaign site.'
