Making a online order calculator and had an issue I never ran into before: some margin between the input, select, and input(type=submit) that just wouldn't go away. Everything should have fit with the 30/40/30% split. Nothing was revealed upon closer inspection so I headed over to stackoverflow to figure it out. Turns out it is the white space between the elements. Easy fix, but quite odd. The more you know!
