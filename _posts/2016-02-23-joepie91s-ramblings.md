description: 'This article is meant to be an introduction to functional programming in Javascript - specifically, it will explain the map, filter and reduce methods. While these are natively available in any recent browser and in Node.js, most articles on them are far too technical to understand, while the concept of these functions is actually really simple, and will benefit any developer - even those working on simple scripts.'
