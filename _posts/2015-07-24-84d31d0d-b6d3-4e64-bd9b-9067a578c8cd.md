You've landed at my personal blog, newsfeed, and general place I share the things I'm learning, applying, and enjoying out here on the web. It's built with the new AI design platform, The Grid. It is currently in beta but I am really excited to help make it the best experience out there.The community is already great to work with and the developers and designers are very active in responding to questions and bugs. If this seems awesome to you, which it is, learn more and sign up here https://thegrid.io/\#1069 . ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/314683f0-fa65-4e53-aac2-662259e4e543.jpg)
