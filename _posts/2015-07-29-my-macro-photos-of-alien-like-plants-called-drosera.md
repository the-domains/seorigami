description: "My name is Joni Niemelä and I'm a fine art nature photographer from Finland. My works consist mostly of the nature around me and especially those little details which are often overseen. Although I have been doing macro photography for several years now my fascination for alien-like plants called Droseras also known as Sundews have grown more and more in the last couple of years."
