description: "All photos courtesy Cindy Chinn We've seen a number of artists working with pencil leads over the last few years, where the narrow dimensions of graphite are carved into miniscule objects. This recent piece by Nebraska-based artist Cindy Chinn is particularly ingenious, an entire carpenter's pencil is turned into a tiny train, trestle, and bridge."
