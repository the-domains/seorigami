description: "The \"Dark Matter Developer\" moniker has been floating around for several years. Scott Hanselman introduced the term to describe developers who do not have active online or social personas: They don't read a lot of blogs, they never write blogs, they don't go to user groups, they don't tweet or facebook, and you don't often see them at large conferences."
