description: 'Spanish sculptor, José Manuel Castro López, creates sculptures that are altering our perception of reality. When you first glance at his works, they just seem like a collection of pinches, twists and wrinkles. But when you realize that the mediums he works with are stones like marble and granite, you stop for a second and ask yourself, how does he do that?'
