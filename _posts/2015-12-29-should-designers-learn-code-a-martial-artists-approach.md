description: "I've been doing Martial Arts since I was 8. I know, I certainly don't look like that. My friends call me \"a bullie's nightmare\". I've done Karate, Krav Maga, 3 years of Tae Kwon Do, then 13 years of CMA which is a combo of the full-contact martial arts: Karate, Muay Thai, Krav Maga for self defence, and some BJJ."
