description: 'WESTON-SUPER-MARE - Inside the walls of a derelict seaside swimming resort in Weston-super-Mare, UK, mysterious construction over the last month-including a dingy looking Disney-like castle and a gargantuan rainbow-colored pinwheel tangled in plastic-suggested something big was afoot. Suspicion and anticipation surrounding the unusual activity attributed to fabled artist and provocateur Banksy has reached a Willy Wonka-esque fervor.'
