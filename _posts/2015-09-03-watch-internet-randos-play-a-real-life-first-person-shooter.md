description: "How would you survive the zombie apocalypse? We've all thought about it, but British-based studio Realm Pictures has allowed a handful of internet randos the chance to live it. Using anonymous chat sites Chatroulette and Omegle, with some extra help from Skype callers, the studio put together a real-time choose-your-own adventure dressed up in the style of a video game first-person shooter."
