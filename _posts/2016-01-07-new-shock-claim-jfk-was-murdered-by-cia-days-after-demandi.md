description: "Ex-marine misfit Lee Harvey Oswald, 24, was charged with the shooting, which he denied, but he too was shot dead by nightclub boss Jack Ruby before he could go on trial. In November, James Files, 72, a Mafia hit man in jail for separate murders claimed in an interview that he had been a sniper on the day of JFK's death and fired a shot at his head."
