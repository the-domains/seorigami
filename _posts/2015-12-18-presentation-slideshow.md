description: "A simple presentation template in CSS and jQuery. Although presentations are usually created using native apps, we decided to challenge ourselves and design a presentation template for the browser. It wasn't an easy task, for the way you interact with a presentation slideshow is different compared to how you scroll through a website: each unit/slide must be isolated, so that its content can be assimilated before switching to the next one."
