            <title><![CDATA[Cloudflare HTTP/2 Benchmark Testing]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Cloudflare HTTP/2 Benchmark Testing</h1><p>  Wes Bos over at @wesbos tweeted that Cloudflare sent him an email this morning on automatic upgrades to HTTP/2 with SPDY. After some checking around I learned a bit more an ran some tests with my coworker @HTMelvis to see what we came up with.

Making a rough draft to quickly post up here on my grid site, not sure how much HTML I can use here, so please forgive the lack of tables. I'll post a nice version on my main site when I can.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Carved Graphite Train on Tracks Emerges from Inside a Carpenter's Pencil</h1><p>All photos courtesy Cindy Chinn We've seen a number of artists working with pencil leads over the last few years, where the narrow dimensions of graphite are carved into miniscule objects. This recent piece by Nebraska-based artist Cindy Chinn is particularly ingenious, an entire carpenter's pencil is turned into a tiny train, trestle, and bridge.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1b205e4583e991257e94b043d45c918d1bf3fbb2.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Presentation Slideshow</h1><p>A simple presentation template in CSS and jQuery. Although presentations are usually created using native apps, we decided to challenge ourselves and design a presentation template for the browser. It wasn't an easy task, for the way you interact with a presentation slideshow is different compared to how you scroll through a website: each unit/slide must be isolated, so that its content can be assimilated before switching to the next one.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/af258580d32c611456df16f7f8b3e00ea2d1854a.png"></article>]]></description>
