            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Cloudflare HTTP/2 Benchmark Testing</h1><p>  Wes Bos over at @wesbos tweeted that Cloudflare sent him an email this morning on automatic upgrades to HTTP/2 with SPDY. After some checking around I learned a bit more an ran some tests with my coworker @HTMelvis to see what we came up with.

Making a rough draft to quickly post up here on my grid site, not sure how much HTML I can use here, so please forgive the lack of tables. I'll post a nice version on my main site when I can.
